<h1> Hyperia is the most overrated coaster in the UK!!!!<h>

<p> It is glazed to much for being the best coaster </p>

<p> remember people height != good woah python!!!! </p>

<p>the airtime is pretty good but the ride is 30 seconds long...</p>

<p>in my opinion the flying fish is the best mack rides gmbh & co kg product in the uk as its very thrilling!!!! who cares about icon, runaway mine train, storm chaser and whatever else we have!!!! </p>

<h1>Why Rita is better than Stealth (coming from a intellectual)
  
<p>Number 1: Rita's train is better looking compared to stealth!</p>

<img src="Images/IMG_0086.jpeg" alt="hyperia L">
<img src="Images/IMG_0087.jpeg" alt="hyperia L">
  
<p>your probably thinking but they are basically the same!!??!?!?! its just the stock intamin train...</p>
<p>Rita's has ten times more aura than stealths cause its got a tuff colour scheme!!!</p>

<p>Number 2: Rita's launch audio is 10 times more tuff (i think its more out of sync than stealths but that adds to the aura!!!)

<p>

</audio>
</p>

<p>Number 3: Rita is tuff as its layout is epic!!!!</p>
<p>Stealth: Launch, Tophat, Airtime Hill, Brakes, Turn, Waiting Block, Turn, Transfer, Unload, Load.</p>
<p>Rita: Launch: Helix, Twisted Airtime Hill, Helix, Airtime Hill, Helix, Airtime Outerbank Hill Thing, Hop into slow down brakes, Turn, Trim Brake, Turn, Waiting Brake,Transfer, Unload, Load.</p>

<p>Rita is more tuff as its got more elements!! Stealth just has a tophat and airtime hill which you think would be good but no the brakes start when your meant to get airtime....</p>

<p>Rita is also more tuff as its got thirteen next door which is very tuff. (Gold Rush vs Thirteen soon!?!?!?!?!)</p>
